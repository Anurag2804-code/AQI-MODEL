Air Quality Analysis Model

💨 Overview

This repository contains the Python-based model for analyzing and predicting Air Quality Index (AQI) based on various environmental and time-series factors. The model is designed to process raw pollutant data (e.g., PM2.5, NO2, O3) and provide actionable insights into air quality trends, potential pollution sources, and future forecasts.

This tool is primarily built using Python and leverages libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn (for modeling), and Matplotlib (for visualization).

✨ Features

Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, performs feature scaling, and aggregates time-series data to daily/hourly AQI readings.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generates visualizations and statistical summaries of pollutant trends.

Predictive Modeling: Implements a time-series or regression model (e.g., ARIMA, Random Forest, or LSTM) to forecast future AQI values.

Source Attribution: Provides preliminary analysis on which pollutants or environmental factors have the highest correlation with AQI fluctuations.

Report Generation: Saves key findings and forecast plots as image files for easy reporting.

📊 Data Input

The model expects the raw air quality data in a CSV format.

File Name: data/raw_air_quality_data.csv

Required Columns:

Column Name

Data Type

Description

timestamp

datetime

Date and time of the reading (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS).

PM2.5

float

Particulate Matter 2.5 concentration (in µg/m³).

NO2

float

Nitrogen Dioxide concentration.

O3

float

Ozone concentration.

SO2

float

Sulfur Dioxide concentration.

CO

float

Carbon Monoxide concentration.

Temp

float

Ambient temperature (Optional, for feature engineering).

Ensure your data file is placed in the data/ directory before running the script.

🏃 Usage

The project is structured around a main script that executes the data loading, training, and prediction pipeline.

1. Run the analysis pipeline

Execute the main script from the root directory:

python main.py


2. View Results

Upon successful execution, the following files will be generated in the output/ directory:

output/aqi_forecast_plot.png: A plot showing the predicted vs. actual AQI values and the future forecast.

output/feature_importance.csv: A CSV file detailing the importance score of each input feature in the final model.

output/model_summary.txt: A text file containing the model's training metrics (e.g., MAE, RMSE).

💡 Model Methodology

The core of this analysis uses a [State the type of model, e.g., Scikit-learn Random Forest Regressor] model.

Feature Engineering: Time-based features (day of week, hour of day) and lagged pollutant values are created.

Training: The model is trained on the historical data (up to the last [X] days/months).

Validation: Cross-validation is used to optimize hyperparameters.

Prediction: The final model is used to generate a [e.g., 7-day] forecast of the Air Quality Index.
